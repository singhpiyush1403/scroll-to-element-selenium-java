# scroll-to-element-selenium-java
This Java project demonstrates how to scroll to a specific element using Selenium WebDriver. It uses JavascriptExecutor to bring the target element into view on a webpage. The script navigates to Calculator.net and scrolls to the "Loan Calculator" link. Useful for automation testing scenarios where elements are not immediately visible.
